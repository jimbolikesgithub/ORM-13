# Employee-Tracker-12

--- This challenge had us create URL requests which would work in conjunction with our sequelize tables and seed data. IF the User were to visit, say, the categories URL, they would view a table of seeded mock data from which was hardcoded. If they wished to add AND/OR edit AND/OR delete any data residing in the tables, they most certainly could. Loved this challenge. ---
